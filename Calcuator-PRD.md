Here‚Äôs a detailed PRD (Product Requirements Document) for your Newsletter Growth & Revenue Calculator, formatted for use with an AI coding developer (like GPT-4 for code generation, Replit, or a human dev). You can copy-paste this as a single prompt or break it into sections for multi-step implementation.

üìÑ PRD: Newsletter Growth & Revenue Calculator
üéØ Goal

Based on niche, suggest one or two channels:

e.g., ‚ÄúFor Creator Economy: Focus on Twitter + short-form video lead magnets.‚Äù

üìê Calculation Logic
Subscriber Growth Formula:

text
Copy
Edit
subs_month_n = subs_month_(n-1) + (growth_rate √ó subs_month_(n-1)) ‚Äì (unsubscribe_rate √ó subs_month_(n-1)) + paid_subs
Revenue:

text
Copy
Edit
projected_subs √ó ARPU
Ad Spend Conversion (per niche):

Niche	Avg CPA (‚Ç¨)
Creator	1.50
SaaS/Marketing	2.00
Finance	2.50
Fitness	1.20
Career	1.50
Tech/AI	1.75
Local	0.60

üß† Prompt Example for GPT-4 Code Tool
Here‚Äôs how you can paste this into an AI coding tool directly:

Prompt:

Build a single-page web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app is a "Newsletter Growth & Revenue Calculator" that includes:

A form with inputs: Niche (dropdown), Current Subscribers (number), Monthly Growth Rate (%), Unsubscribe Rate (%), Monetization Model (dropdown), ARPU (number), and Monthly Ad Budget (‚Ç¨).

Output section showing:

Projected subscribers (3/6/12 months)

Monthly/annual revenue

Paid growth impact if ad budget is filled

ROI of ad spend

A text recommendation of best lead gen strategy based on niche

Use default assumptions:

CPA by niche

ARPU defaults by niche/monetization model

Subscriber growth = current + (growth rate ‚Äì unsubscribe rate + paid subs)

Add a simple chart (Chart.js or ApexCharts) to show growth over 12 months.

Style the app with Tailwind or clean CSS. Mobile friendly. Add a footer CTA linking to my workshop: ‚ÄúWant the system behind this? Join The Newsletter Operator.‚Äù

Return the full HTML/CSS/JS code for deployment. Don‚Äôt use a backend.

Let me know if you want:

Code generation (I can write the JS logic next)

A preview in Google Sheets
