# PRD: AI Dev Tasks - Structured Workflow System for AI-Powered Development

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Document Title and Version
- **PRD**: AI Dev Tasks - Structured Workflow System for AI-Powered Development
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: January 2025

### 1.2 Product Summary

AI Dev Tasks is a structured workflow system that transforms chaotic AI-powered development into a systematic, reliable process. The system provides a collection of markdown-based templates and methodologies that guide developers through feature development using AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf.

The core innovation addresses the "black box" problem of AI development by breaking complex features into three distinct phases: comprehensive planning (PRD creation), detailed task breakdown, and systematic implementation with built-in verification checkpoints. This approach significantly improves code quality, reduces debugging time, and gives developers confidence in AI-generated solutions.

By replacing monolithic AI requests with structured, step-by-step guidance, AI Dev Tasks enables teams to leverage AI assistants more effectively while maintaining control over the development process and ensuring consistent, reviewable outcomes.

- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple templates that can be enhanced with additional prompts and customizations
- **Visual Progress**: Clear task completion indicators and progress tracking through standard markdown formatting

## 6. Narrative

**The Problem**: Developers using AI coding assistants often struggle with inconsistent results, getting lost in complex features, and lack confidence in AI-generated code. The typical approach of writing large, monolithic prompts leads to unpredictable outcomes and difficult-to-debug issues.

**The Solution**: AI Dev Tasks provides a structured methodology that breaks down complex development work into manageable, verifiable steps. By enforcing a disciplined approach of thorough planning, detailed task breakdown, and systematic implementation, developers can leverage AI assistants reliably while maintaining control and understanding.

**The Transformation**: Instead of wrestling with AI "black boxes," developers follow a clear path from idea to implementation. Each step builds confidence through verification, and the systematic approach creates learning opportunities that improve future AI interactions. Teams can adopt consistent practices that scale across projects and developers.
